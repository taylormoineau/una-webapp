# una-webapp
Repository for the RBU UNA Webapp.

Currently a work in progress.

I will just copy/paste the proposal here for initial instructions and a reference sheet.

Project Proposal for UNA webapp



Key statement:

We propose to create a mobile-first web app for the UNA Clubs which will not only act as a modern eye-catching website to which we direct interested traffic, but also an administration app, which will allow RBU members to quickly and seamlessly generate all the assets (books, shirts, crafts, etc)  needed for the individual UNA Clubs and provide some method of collection/distribution for UNA leaders in their respective villages. The hope is to streamline the whole process, increasing the quality and reducing the amount of work, while also creating something that is not reliant on one or two specific people.


The page itself will be a “Web App”. Both a public website and an application to handle some of the required processes. It will be broken into 4 (or more or less) main sections:

Main UNA Page
Administrators Page
UNA Leaders Page
Left open - Potentially, a way to donate if you are interested in supporting UNA? Donor’s page?

*It is important to remember the entire website (including any videos) will need to be translated into at least 3 languages.
Main UNA Page 

We propose to create a themed web page which is something of a “marketing page” for UNA. Its goal is to clearly explain the core elements of the UNA Club, the social/educational impact of the UNA Club, and to give an easy method to inquire about hosting an UNA Club in one’s local area.

It will be modern, flashy, and appropriately themed. Highly informational, and really visually appealing. With some area or method for inquiry with an RBU contact-point, if you are interested in learning more about how to host. Right now the UNA Club spreads only from word-of-mouth and when we occasionally send someone to go inquire at interested villages. If we make a good page, we could direct traffic there through ads, brochure distribution, or even just handing out “business cards” with the website address. 

On this page there will be an area where one might apply to be a “host” for an UNA Club. How we select hosts will need to be determined later on an administrative level. Once that is decided, we will be providing them with a username and password which allows them to access the UNA Host Page (see page 3).





UNA Administrators Page

We propose to create a section of this website which functions to help the RBU members who administrate UNA to quickly put together assets and the translations that go with them. Here are the typical assets with an UNA Club meeting or Festival:

1-3 UNA Club coloring books
1-3 “ABC” Coloring books (these are just simplified versions of the above, for younger ages)
Crafting activity to go alongside the book
Song print-outs.
Big Book
UNA Club tee-shirts (given during once-a-year UNA Festivals)

First the UNA Web App will provide a page for the coloring-book artist to submit new graphic assets (jpg, png, etc.) for the coloring books.

We propose to create a page which dynamically displays the any created UNA Material you select, with its current English text in place, and provides an area which accepts a translation. On “submitting” a completed translation, the UNA Web App compiles everything, including the translation, into a print-ready PDF.

UNA Web App will provide an easy way to create an order for printed coloring books. It will either send that order directly to a printer, or at least provide instructions for doing so. 

Files which are already translated will be easily accessed on this page, preventing overlap.

UNA Web App will provide an easy way to create an order for teeshirts with appropriate sizes, colors, etc. It will then either directly send the order to a shirt-printer, or at least, provide instructions for ordering.

The current system causes too many mistakes and relies too heavily on one person to handle drawing, collecting translations, and formatting. This whole process will cut down on many emails.



UNA Hosts Page

We propose to provide a page where the “hosts” for individual UNA Clubs. On this page they will find instructional videos and papers which train them in hosting an UNA Club. They will also gain access to all(?) of our assets and a schedule for future Clubs. 

The idea being to resource them completely in their task, and cut out much of the back-and-forth instruction which has happened in the past. The less we require translated emails and




Sponsor Page (optional, subject to change)

(Jelle I know we haven’t talked about this.. I just thought of the idea a little while ago. Drag-n-drop image files uploaded on one page could be easily displayed on another page.)

One proposal is to create a donation page whereby an interested church or church group -in the local area or elsewhere- might be able to “sponsor” a specific UNA Club or festival.

We would provide an area to receive one-time funds.

We would also provide a separate page where an individual, group, or organization could sign up to become sponsor(s) for a specific village. It would need to accommodate a monthly donation. They would then be able to log in to their own “sponsor” version of the UNA Web App, and check in on their sponsored UNA Club.

If we go this route, we could require that hosts share a small bit of info and maybe a few pictures for their sponsors at the end of each event. The “host page” could accommodate that input, which is then displayed on the “sponsor page”.

If we provide incentives and an easy way to communicate, we will likely acquire more interested donors. The current method of checking Facebook from time-to-time and hoping to see a picture will not support the kind of expansion we want to see in UNA.
